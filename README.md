# Projet-RPI

Use of a Joy-Pi experimental case for Raspberry Pi (https://www.elektor.fr/joy-pi-experimenters-briefcase-for-raspberry-pi).

The aim of this project was to use cross-compilation in C to develop a game on the Raspberry in the case.  
In my team, composed of 2 students, we used a button matrix, individual buttons, 7 segment displays, a buzzer and the RPI.  
The JoyPi library was used to complete this project.  
The goal of the game was to create music scores on a terminal and the application had to be able to display and play them back.
